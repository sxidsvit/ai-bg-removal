## Erase Background 

[SITE](https://erase-bg-sxidsvit.vercel.app/)

### Core Application Idea 
The  site is designed to automatically remove background from images. The /remove-bg API route, which is used for image processing and background removal. The site provides a simple to use web interface where the user can upload an image and then get a version without background.

### Basic features
#### 1. Frontend (client part):
- Based on React.js using React Router for routing.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
- AXIOS is used to send HTTP requests.
- Designed with the Vite Collector, which speeds up development and improves performance.

#### 2. Backend (server part):
- Works on Node.js using Express.
- For data storage MongoDB is used.
- Integration with Razorpay and Stripe payment systems to provide paid services (for example, adding credits for image processing).
- Authentication and authorization are performed via JSON Web Token.
- Processing of file downloads with Multer.
- Integration of a third-party API for image processing (e.g., CLIPDROP API).

#### 3. Main API routes:

##### User Router:
- Processing payments via Razorpay and Stripe.
- Check user credit.
- Webhooks for updates.

##### Image Router:
- Background removal via /remove-bg API.

#### 4. Configuration via . env:

- Environment variables contain API keys and configuration settings for the client and server.
